Problem Description
• Oil spills represent a major threat to ocean ecosystems and their health
• The recent incident in the Gulf of Mexico demonstrates the potentially catastrophic
nature of offshore oil spills
• Prevention of illicit pollution requires continuous monitoring and satellite remote sensing
technology represents an attractive option for operational oil spill detection
• Oil spill binary classification is a type of machine learning problem aimed at identifying oil
spills in satellite or aerial imagery
• Oil spill detection is a crucial part of minimizing the impact of spills and ensuring the safety
and protection of the environment and communities of underwater affected by spills

Requirement Specification
• Use the Oil Spill Dataset (Dataset Attached) from Kaggle, which contains both nonoil spill
and oil spill images.
• It includes 2800 images for training and 600 images for testing and validation
• Develop an appropriate CNN model for binary classification of whether an oil spill is there
or not Judging Metrics
• Oil Spill Classification – Precision, Recall, Accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix
